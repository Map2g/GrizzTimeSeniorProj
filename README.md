# GrizzTime
CSI 4999 Project - Bizzie Grizzies

To run the project:

1. Double click GrizzTime.sln in the project folder we will be submitting.
      This will open the solution file in Visual Studio.
2. Click IIS Express (Google Chrome) at the top of the window, or press F5 to run it.
3. Click through the project and submit data as you please!

The team did not have time to move the project to a web server, so it will run on your device's local host server. We decided to focus on the project's functionality and look instead of moving it to a Web Server on a VPS.
